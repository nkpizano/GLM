```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

##Lets enter the data for binomial using the logit link - y response is equal to proportion of failures and success
```{r}
Ldose<-rep(0:5,2) #log-base2 dosages of the toxin given by Idose
numdead<-c(1,4,9,13,18,20,0,2,6,10,12,16) #the number of dead budworms are given by the numdead
sex<-factor(rep(c("M", "F"),c(6,6)))#sex is a factor with male and female assignment
SF<-cbind(numdead, numalive=20-numdead) #number of alibe are given by subtracting 20 from numdead
print(SF) #starting on line seven we have the number of dead and alive females budwoms
```
## Run a GLM using the logit link
```{r}
budworm<-glm(formula = SF~ -1+ sex+Ldose, family= binomial)
summary(budworm)
```
